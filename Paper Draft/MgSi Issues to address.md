### MgSi Issues to address

#### Rebecca Fischer

* Issues with Badro/Hirose data not being correct
  * make a point of saying "IF" this data is correct

#### Nick Knezek

* Initial temperatures are too hot? Whole mantle is melted. 
  * Maybe only do cooler temperature runs
  * Maybe it doesn't matter because reactions are similar if there is a magma ocean present
* Solid state is incorrect way to treat mantle?

#### Issues brought up in emails

* Mg# 0.8 reason? 
  * Tushar - some citations for 0.8
  * maybe should use 0.9
* address density in core from other light elements
  * our core is too heavy
  * have to explain density deficit through use of other 
  * will only change story for iron slightly
  * system should include species that react in equilibrium
  * need other light elements like: S, C, He, H (citations)
* Violin plot for Mg, Si, O wt% in core
  * ​

#### New Runs

* Mg# 0.9?
* cooler initial tempetures?
* new latent heat numbers?
* Mg# equal in Bridgemanite and (Mg,Fe)O
  * Bridgemanite Mg# 10-40% of Mg# in (Mg,Fe)O
  * ​

#### New Plot

* climate plot of total heatflow out
  * CMB heatflow
  * uppermantle heatflow
