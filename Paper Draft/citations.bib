abstract = {The Earth acts as a gigantic heat engine driven by the decay of radiogenic isotopes and slow cooling, which gives rise to plate tectonics, volcanoes and mountain building. Another key product is the geomagnetic field, generated in the liquid iron core by a dynamo running on heat released by cooling and freezing (as the solid inner core grows), and on chemical convection (due to light elements expelled from the liquid on freezing). The power supplied to the geodynamo, measured by the heat flux across the core-mantle boundary (CMB), places constraints on Earth's evolution. Estimates of CMB heat flux depend on properties of iron mixtures under the extreme pressure and temperature conditions in the core, most critically on the thermal and electrical conductivities. These quantities remain poorly known because of inherent experimental and theoretical difficulties. Here we use density functional theory to compute these conductivities in liquid iron mixtures at core conditions from first principles--unlike previous estimates, which relied on extrapolations. The mixtures of iron, oxygen, sulphur and silicon are taken from earlier work and fit the seismologically determined core density and inner-core boundary density jump. We find both conductivities to be two to three times higher than estimates in current use. The changes are so large that core thermal histories and power requirements need to be reassessed. New estimates indicate that the adiabatic heat flux is 15 to 16 terawatts at the CMB, higher than present estimates of CMB heat flux based on mantle convection; the top of the core must be thermally stratified and any convection in the upper core must be driven by chemical convection against the adverse thermal buoyancy or lateral variations in CMB heat flow. Power for the geodynamo is greatly restricted, and future models of mantle evolution will need to incorporate a high CMB heat flux and explain the recent formation of the inner core.},

abstract = {Abstract The rate at which heat is extracted across the core mantle boundary (CMB) is constrained by the requirement of dynamo action in the core. This constraint can be computed explicitly using the entropy balance of the core and depends on the thermal conductivity, whose value has been revised upwardly. A high order model (fourth degree polynomial of the radial position) for the core structure is derived and the implications for the core cooling rate and thermal evolution obtained, using the recent values of the thermal conductivity. For a thermal conductivity increasing with depth as proposed by some of these recent studies, a CMB heat flow equal to the isentropic value (13.25 TW at present) leads to a 700 km thick layer at the top of the core where a downward convective heat flow is necessary to maintain an isentropic and well mixed average state. Considering a CMB heat flow larger than the well mixed isentropic value leads to an inner core less than 700 Myr old and the thermal evolution of the core is largely constrained by the conditions for dynamo action without an inner core. Analytical calculations for that period show that a CMB temperature larger than 7000 K must have prevailed 4.5 Gyr ago if the geodynamo has been driven by thermal convection for that whole time. This raises questions regarding the onset of the geodynamo and its continuous operation for the last 3.5 Gyr. Implications regarding the evolution of a basal magma ocean are also considered.},

@article{Stevenson1983,
abstract = {Of the terrestrial planets, Earth and probably Mercury possess substantial intrinsic magnetic fields generated by core dynamos, while Venus and Mars apparently lack such fields. Thermal histories are calculated for these planets and are found to admit several possible present states, including those which suggest simple explanations for the observations; whule the cores of Earth and Mercury are continuing to freeze, the cores of Venus and Mars may still be completely liquid. The models assume whole mantle convection, which is parameterized by a simple Nusselt-Rayleigh number relation and dictates the rate at which heat escapes from the core. It is found that completely fluid cores, devoid of intrinsic heat sources, are not likely to sustain thermal convection for the age of the solar system but cool to a subadiabatic, conductive state that can not maintain a dynamo. Planets which nucleate an inner core continue to sustain a dynamo because of the gravitational energy release and chemically driven convection that accompany inner core growth. The absence of a significant inner core can arise in Venus because of its slightly higher temperature and lower central pressure relative to Earth, while a Martian core avoids the onset of freezing if the abundance of sulfur in the core is âª†15{\%} by mass. All of the models presented assume that (
I) core dynamos are driven by thermal and/or chemical convection; (
ii) radiogenic heat production is confined to the mantle; (
iii) mantle and core cool from initially hot states which are at the solidus and superliquidus, respectively; and (
iv) any inner core excludes the light alloying material (sulfur or oxygen) which then mixes uniformly upward through the outer core. The models include realistic pressure and composition-dependent freezing curves for the core, and material parameters are chosen so that the correct present-day values of heat outflow, upper mantle temperature and viscosity, and inner core radius are obtained for the earth. It is found that Venus and Mars may have once had dynamos maintained by thermal convection alone. Earth may have had a completely fluid core and a dynamo maintained by thermal convection for the first 2 to 3 by, but an inner core nucleates and the dynamo energetics are subsequently dominated by gravitational energy release. Complete freezing of the Mercurian core is prohibited if it contains even a small amount of sulfur, and a dynamo can be maintained by chemical convection in a thin, fluid shell.},

abstract = {Energy considerations indicate that the power delivered to the present-day geodynamo comes mainly from the growth of the solid inner core, through light element and latent heat releases. The nucleation of the inner core was, therefore, a major transition for the geodynamo. Here, we use numerical dynamo simulations linked by thermochemical evolution of the core to investigate the effects of inner-core nucleation (ICN) on the geodynamo, and identify possible ICN footprints in the palaeomagnetic field. Our results suggest that a strong-field dipole-dominated dynamo prior and after ICN (the uniformitarian scenario) is most likely. We predict little footprint of ICN on the surface field intensity, consistent with the observed lack of a long-term trend in paleointensity data. Instead, we find that the best proxy for inner-core growth is an increase in axial octupole strength with age, from present-day to ICN, which might be resolvable in the palaeomagnetic record. We confirm the existence of weak-field, multipolar dynamos prior to ICN, suggesting the dynamo might have transiently reached a weak-field state (the catastrophic scenario). The narrow stability domain of these weak-field dynamos implies that the catastrophic scenario is less probable than the uniformitarian scenario.},

abstract = {Paleomagnetic data from ancient rocks are one of the few types of observational data that can be brought to be bear on the long-term evolution of Earth's core. A recent compilation of paleointensity estimates from throughout Earth history has been interpreted to indicate that Earth's magnetic field strength increased in the Mesoproterozoic (between 1.5 and 1.0 billion years ago), with this increase taken to mark the onset of inner core nucleation. However, much of the data within the Precambrian paleointensity database are from Thellier-style experiments with non-ideal behavior that manifests in results such as double-slope Arai plots. Choices made when interpreting these data may significantly change conclusions about long-term trends in the intensity of Earth's geomagnetic field. In this study, we present new paleointensity results from volcanics of the âˆ¼1.1 billion-year-old North American Midcontinent Rift. While most of the results exhibit non-ideal double-slope or sagging behavior in Arai plots, some flows have more ideal single-slope behavior leading to paleointensity estimates that may be some of the best constraints on the strength of Earth's field for this time. Taken together, new and previously published paleointensity data from the Midcontinent Rift yield a median field strength estimate of 56.0 ZAm2â€”very similar to the median for the past 300 million years. These field strength estimates are distinctly higher than those for the preceding billion years after excluding ca. 1.3 Ga data that may be biased by non-ideal behaviorâ€”consistent with an increase in field strength in the late Mesoproterozoic. However, given that âˆ¼90 per cent of paleointensity estimates from 1.1 to 0.5 Ga come from the Midcontinent Rift, it is difficult to evaluate whether these high values relative to those estimated for the preceding billion years are the result of a stepwise, sustained increase in dipole moment. Regardless, paleointensity estimates from the Midcontinent Rift indicate that the surface expression of Earth's geomagnetic field at âˆ¼1.1 Ga may have been similar to that on the present-day Earth.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature. All rights reserved.The Earth's core is about ten per cent less dense than pure iron (Fe), suggesting that it contains light elements as well as iron. Modelling of core formation at high pressure (around 40-60 gigapascals) and high temperature (about 3,500 kelvin) in a deep magma ocean predicts that both silicon (Si) and oxygen (O) are among the impurities in the liquid outer core. However, only the binary systems Fe-Si and Fe-O have been studied in detail at high pressures, and little is known about the compositional evolution of the Fe-Si-O ternary alloy under core conditions. Here we performed melting experiments on liquid Fe-Si-O alloy at core pressures in a laser-heated diamond-anvil cell. Our results demonstrate that the liquidus field of silicon dioxide (SiO2) is unexpectedly wide at the iron-rich portion of the Fe-Si-O ternary, such that an initial Fe-Si-O core crystallizes SiO2 as it cools. If crystallization proceeds on top of the core, the buoyancy released should have been more than sufficient to power core convection and a dynamo, in spite of high thermal conductivity, from as early on as the Hadean eon. SiO2 saturation also sets limits on silicon and oxygen concentrations in the present-day outer core.},

We propose a suction mechanism that maintains a porous medium on the mantle side of the CMB, with the interconnected pore-space partly or entirely filled with liquid iron up to a thickness of ?1 km. The suction arises from the deviatoric stresses supported by the mantle-solid in regions of mantle downwelling. Infiltration of liquid iron occurs by percolation, but is inhibited by the rate of viscous dilation of the solid mantle. Our model enables core-mantle material exchange, and maintains a thin conducting layer that has seismic detection potential. Our model is only marginally satisfactory in explaining the inferred CMB coupling.},

abstract = {Interactions between the core and the mantle arise when heat, mass, momentum, or charge is transferred across the core-mantle boundary (CMB). Each of these interactions has consequences for the dynamics and evolution of the Earth's interior. Thermal interactions are typically the result of changes in the magnitude or spatial pattern of heat flow across the CMB. These interactions evolve slowly on the timescale of convective overturn in the mantle (nominally 107-108years). The style of convection in the core and the regeneration of the magnetic field are dramatically altered by plausible changes in CMB heat flow. Electromagnetic and mechanical interactions occur on shorter timescales and may be responsible for observed fluctuations in the Earth's rotation rate over periods ranging from several decades to several days. More uncertain are the chemical interactions which result from transfer of mass across the CMB. Differences in the average oxidation state of the core and the mantle make chemical reactions between these two regions likely, yet the evidence for mass exchange remains controversial. We review recent advances in our understanding of core-mantle interactions. We also explore the role of core-mantle interactions in making internal processes detectable at the Earth's surface. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The results for pure MgO are in excellent agreement with first-principles calculations. In samples doped with Al2O3, cation vacancies were found to attach to Al impurities with a binding energy of similar to 0.7 eV. Our results predict that a transition from diffusion creep to dislocation creep will occur in the deep lower mantle if the shear stress exceeds similar to 1 - 10 MPa, for a grain size of similar to 0.1 - 1 mm. Diffusion through periclase is fast enough to allow substantial chemical exchange across the core-mantle boundary since core formation, with length scales of similar to 1-10 km for lattice diffusion and 100 km for grain boundary diffusion.},

abstract = {Lower mantle seismic scatterers are often interpreted in terms of subducted basaltic crust, which should contain free-silica phases that are seismically fast. However, free-silica phases are unstable in a peridotite lower mantle, as they react with ferropericlase (magnesiowustite) to form silicate perovskite. Nonetheless, conservative estimates and recent measurements of diffusion coefficients in silicate perovskite suggest that free-silica phases may persist as polycrystalline armored relics in lower mantle peridotite at length scales equivalent to those observed for seismic scatterers. Simple numerical simulations also suggest that polycrystalline silica may persist within subducted metabasalts. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Understanding the geochemical behaviour of the siderophile elements - those tending to form alloys with iron in natural environments - is important in the search for a deep-mantle chemical 'fingerprint' in upper mantle rocks, and also in the evaluation of models of large-scale differentiation of the Earth and terrestrial planets. These elements are highly concentrated in the core relative to the silicate mantle, but their concentrations in upper mantle rocks are higher than predicted by most core-formation models(1,2). It has been suggested that mixing of outer-core material back into the mantle following core formation may be responsible for the siderophile element ratios observed in upper mantle rocks(3). Such re-mixing has been attributed to an unspecified metal - silicate interaction in the reactive D" layer just above the core - mantle boundary(4). The siderophile elements are excellent candidates as indicators of an outer-core contribution to the mantle, but the nature and existence of possible core - mantle interactions is controversial(5). In light of the recent findings that grain-boundary diffusion of oxygen through a dry intergranular medium may be effective over geologically significant length scales(6) and that grain boundaries can be primary storage sites for incompatible lithophile elements(7), the question arises as to whether siderophile elements might exhibit similar (or greater) grain-boundary mobility. Here we report experimental results from a study of grain-boundary diffusion of siderophile elements through polycrystalline MgO that were obtained by quantifying the extent of alloy formation between initially pure metals separated by similar to 1 mm of polycrystalline MgO. Grain-boundary diffusion resulted in significant alloying of sink and source particles, enabling calculation of grain-boundary fluxes. Our computed diffusivities were high enough to allow transport of a number of siderophile elements over geologically significant length scales (tens of kilometres) over the age of the Earth. This finding establishes grain-boundary diffusion as a potential fast pathway for chemical communication between the core and mantle.},
