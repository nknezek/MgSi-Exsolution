## Main Points we want to hit

- **FeO exsolution is important source of entropy for dynamo**
  - smaller density contrast than SiO2 or MgO but larger amount available
  - potential relationships to LLSVPs and ULVZs at CMB
- **Dynamo power history over time for paleomag**
  - many different entropy histories possible
  - exsolution supresses signal of inner-core nucleation
  - histogram plot or climate plot of IC nucleation times 
- Mantle dynamics
  - overturn timecale shorter than layer instability timescale
  - "conveyer belt" effect of mantle composition

### Problems to point out

- We don't take into account heat of reaction (Q_H in Nimmo 2015)
  - probably a small effect compared to Q_L and Q_g for exsolution. 
  - swamped by uncertainties in model
- We don't track the change in core composition that arises due to inner-core growth. 
  - reason: We don't know the partitioning of each element into the outer core.
  - effect: we slightly underestimate the wt% of light elements in the outer core at the present day
    - our values represnt the volume-average over the whole core, when in reality the inner-core is depleted in light elements and outer core is enriched
  - effect: our model underestimates the exsolution at present day 
    - in equilibrium, any light elements exsolved from the core would then be exsolved into the mantle as the core was already at equilbrium.â€‹
