## Points we want to hit

* **FeO exsolution is important source of entropy for dynamo**
  - smaller density contrast than SiO2 or MgO but larger amount available
  - potential relationships to LLSVPs and ULVZs at CMB
* **Dynamo power history over time for paleomag**
  - many different entropy histories possible
  - inner core nucleation is still a relatively strong, positive signal
    - histogram plot or climate plot of IC nucleation times 
* **Chemical exchange between core and mantle is governed by mantle**
  - nucleation occurs on base of mantle
  - have to care about mantle composition
* Mantle dynamics
  * overturn timecale shorter than layer instability timescale
  * "conveyer belt" effect of mantle composition

- Core composition significantly evolves over time
  - current composition does not necessarily represent initial composition
- Side points:
  - Core composition
    - initial composition set by possible equilbrium with background mantle at T_0
    - not much oxygen left in valid model runs
    - density contrast must be explained with other light elements



## Problems to point out

* We don't take into account heat of reaction (Q_H in Nimmo 2015)
  * probably a small effect compared to Q_L and Q_g for exsolution. 
  * swamped by uncertainties in model
* We don't track the change in core composition that arises due to inner-core growth. 
  * reason: We don't know the partitioning of each element into the outer core.
  * effect: we slightly underestimate the wt% of light elements in the outer core at the present day
    * our values represnt the volume-average over the whole core, when in reality the inner-core is depleted in light elements and outer core is enriched
  * effect: our model underestimates the exsolution at present day 
    * in equilibrium, any light elements exsolved from the core would then be exsolved into the mantle as the core was already at equilbrium.
